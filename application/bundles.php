| Bundle Configuration

| This is a list of the bundles installed for your application and tells
| Laravel the location of the bundle's root directory, as well as the
| root URI the bundle responds to.
|
| For example, if you have an "admin" bundle located in "bundles/admin" 
| that you want to handle requests with URIs that begin with "admin",
| simply add it to the array like this:
|
|		'admin' => array(
|			'location' => 'admin',
|			'handles'  => 'admin',
|		),
|
| Have a bundle that lives in the root of the bundle directory
| and doesn't respond to any requests? Just add the bundle
| name to the array and we'll take care of the rest.
